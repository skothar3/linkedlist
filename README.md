# linkedlist
This project provides us with a foundation in dynamic datastructures in terms of a linked list. I built a linked list class from scratch using the concept of references/pointers. Each node within the list contains a data value and a reference to the next node. Beginning from the first node ("head"), we can access any other node/data value down to the final node ("tail").
